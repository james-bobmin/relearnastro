    <p><h3>Step 3: Get rid of the things that make you fragile</h3>

        We're taking the negative route for this exercise. Ask yourself: What makes me fragile? Certain people, things, and habits generate losses for us an make us vulnerable. Who and what are they?
        
        When we make our New Year's resolutions, we tend to emphasise adding new challenges to our lives. It's great to have this kind of objective, but setting "good riddance" goals can have an even bigger impact:
        
            Stop snacking between meals
            Eat sweets only once a week
            Gradually pay off all debt
            Avoid spending time with toxic people
            Avoid spending time doing things we don't enjoy, simply because we feel obligated to do them
            Spend no more than twenty minutes on Facebook per day
            
        To build resilience into our lives, we shouldn't fear adversity, because each setback is an opportunity for growth. 
        if we adopt an antifragile attitude, we'll find a way to get stronger with every blow, refining our lifestyle and staying focused on our Ikigai.
        
        Taking a hit or two can be viewed as either a misfortune or and experience that we can apply to all areas of our lives, as we continually make corrections and set new and better goals.
        As Taleb writes in the Antifragile, "We need randomness, adventures, uncertainty, self-discovery, hear traumatic episodes, all these things that make life worth living". We encourage those interested in the concept of antifragility to read Nassim Taleb's Antifragile.
        Life is pure in-perfection, as the philosophy of wabi-sabi teaches us, and the passage of time shows us that everything is fleeting, but if you have a clear sense of your Ikigai, each moment will hold so many possibilities that it will seem almost like an eternity.
