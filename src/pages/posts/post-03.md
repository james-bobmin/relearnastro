## This is from the Book: The Forerunner - page 39

## SAID A SHEET OF SNOW-WHITE PAPER

Said a sheet of snow-white paper, “Pure was I created, and pure will I remain for ever. I would rather be burnt and turn to white ashes than suffer darkness to touch me or the unclean to come near me.”

The ink-bottle heard what the paper was saying, and it laughed in its dark heart; but it never dared to approach her. And the multicoloured pencils heard her also, and they too never came near her.

And the snow-white sheet of paper did remain pure and chaste for ever, pure and chaste – and empty.

-- Kahlil Gibran pg 39 - The Forerunner
