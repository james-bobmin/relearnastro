## Two Great Challenges

We must meet two great challenges on the road to achieving our best effort and spiritual progress. The first occurs in situations when we would like to act differently, but because we are tired, upset or stressed, we resort to old habit patterns. The second happens when we act in newer and better ways, yet we find ourselves dealing with upsetting feelings that contradict what we have done, that manage to sneak up on us automatically.
Both these occurrences are normal. However, if we get into the habit of acknowledging and witnessing what is taking place, rather than becoming overly involved and hard on ourselves, such experiences have less impact.
